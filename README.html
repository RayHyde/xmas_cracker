<p><h1>Christmas cracker jokes</h1></p>
<p><h3>A great British Christmas family tradition...</h3></p>
<p>... badly printed awful jokes in a tacky paper wrapper. And including the obligatory silly paper hat and dodgy toy. Wonderful! For you expats or foreigners who can&#39;t lay your hands on a fresh batch of crackers, here&#39;s something to play with. It&#39;s made in jQuery, the jokes are in a JSON file and the spinning animation is CSS3. Oh, and if you love the sound of a cheezy rimshot, just switch on the sound in the top right corner.</p>

<h2>My Playground</h2>

<p>This project is part of my Playground - a collection of fun (and <em>ahem</em>, dare I say it: clever) stuff I made in the past, from jQuery games and plugins to CSS animation tricks.</p>
